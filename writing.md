# Weapon's choice writing docs

Written as markdown so they are easy to navigate in the GitHub UI.

## Vibes

- A bit goofy
  - Alliteration and rhyming in names
  - Colorful art
- Intentionally slightly dissonant with the themes of the story

## Settings

- Medieval fantasy
- The magic system allows for granting sentience for objects
  - This is what our protagonist and a few supporting characters are
- The main setting is analogous to a workplace or a school
  - The characters are there out of obligation
  - Doing tasks that at best tangentially interest them
  - For other people who seem to enjoy the arrangement more

## Characters

There are two types of characters. Weapons and people.

### Ford the sword (Main Character)

They/Them

- You play as Ford
- Bit of a blank slate
- Does have a few key traits
  - Curiosity, propensity for asking questions.
  - Aversion to violence.

### Coworker swords

Ford has three incredibly French swords as coworkers. Each of them is roughly
based on one of the three values of the French national motto (Liberté, égalité,
fraternité). The swords are a peer group of support characters featured mostly
in cutscenes. All of them start with a "c'est la vie" -attitude to the murder
they commit, which is in slight conflict with Ford.

#### Amber the Saber

She/Her

- Liberté = Freedom
  - Freedom from society and restriction
  - Choice
- She is the chaotic one of the trio
- The first to riot whenever freedom is threatened

#### Pier the Rapier

He/Him

- Égalité = Equality
  - Fairness
  - Equal rights
- He is a bit on the spectrum and insists on fairness in **everything**
- Occasionally clashes with Amber

#### Pepe the Epee

He/Him

- Fraternité = Fraternity
  - Brotherhood
  - Solidarity
- He is the heart of the group, bringing them together
- Loyal to a fault

### Kate the Knight

She/Her

- The handler of the group of swords
- Plays the role of a teacher / supervisor

  - Amber is playfully teasing Ford
  - Pier keeps Amber in line and offers realistic but dry advice
  - Pepe offers words of encouragement and tells Ford to just do their thing and it'll go great

  - The gang is essentially in universe janitors
    - They go into dungeons and make sure and clear out the dangerous stuff
